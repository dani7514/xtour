# xTour


**xTour** mobile application helps users to share their experiences and recommendation to other people about a place that they visited. The places can be historical, towns and cities, and Natural areas. The users can share their experience by uploading photos, videos, and texts that describe how their involvement in their trip went. Users can be entertained and get information by observing other people's posts and making a wishlist for future plans. The posters can get a like and comment from other users. And also the users can get followers based on the content they are displaying on this platform.

**xTour** also provides an opportunity for Users to be *"Journalists"* after validation by the Admin and they can start posting their journals via website links. The journals created will be available to other users after getting approved by the Admin.

The Admin makes sure of the smooth running of the application for the users by making it a safe space for sharing their experiences and authorizing the users for the maintenance of users privacy and security. This is achieved by pending posts and journals made by the user for approval before making them available to other users.
